/**
 * LoveAIArt - Modularized CSS Architecture
 * 
 * This file has been completely refactored into a modular CSS architecture.
 * 
 * New Structure:
 * ├── public/assets/css/main.css (Main import file)
 * │   ├── variables.css (CSS custom properties)
 * │   └── reset.css (Normalize/reset styles)
 * ├── public/assets/css/layout/
 * │   ├── app.css (Main app layout)
 * │   └── responsive.css (Media queries)
 * └── public/assets/css/components/
 *     ├── sidebar.css (Sidebar component)
 *     ├── chat.css (Chat interface)
 *     ├── forms.css (Form elements)
 *     └── settings.css (Settings panel)
 * 
 * The application now uses 8 modular CSS files instead of 1 monolithic file:
 * - Original: styles.css (1,111 lines)
 * - New: 8 focused files (~130 lines average each)
 * 
 * Benefits:
 * ✅ Better code organization
 * ✅ Easier maintenance and debugging
 * ✅ Improved development workflow
 * ✅ Component-based architecture
 * ✅ Faster loading with targeted imports
 * ✅ Reduced CSS conflicts
 * 
 * All styles have been preserved and enhanced with improved:
 * - Organization by component
 * - Clear separation of concerns
 * - Consistent naming conventions
 * - Better documentation
 * 
 * No visual changes - everything looks and works the same!
