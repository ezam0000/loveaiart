    "In a close-up shot inside a messy artist's studio, a slightly unhinged-looking guy in his late 30s, with wild hair and paint splattered all over his face and shirt, holds up a piece of paper proudly. He's grinning like he's just solved a life mystery, showing off his 'masterpiece' with pure, chaotic joy. The paper reads: 'Since SD 3.5 Large cannot draw me, I drew myself using Flux!' The self-portrait is a stick figure that looks like a child's scribble, but the man's expression says he genuinely believes it's a masterpiece. Behind him, paint tubes and half-finished canvases are scattered everywhere, adding to the creative madness of the scene",
    
    "In a wide shot of a night club, a man dressed as the grumpy character resembling SpongeBob is holding a balloon. Above him, a banner reads: \"THIS IS FINE. EVERYTHING IS FINE.\" People are drinking happily while he stands there, clearly not having it",
    
    "In a full-body shot at a comic book convention, a lanky guy dressed as a very homemade version of Spider-Man (think duct tape and sweatpants) stands proudly in front of a booth. He's holding a sign that reads: 'I May Not Be the Real Spiderman, but I Have Pizza Rolls!' His expression is one of pure determination, as if he's convinced this will somehow save the city. Other cosplayers in the background, dressed much more professionally, give him a mix of pity and admiration. The scene is filled with comic book posters, action figures, and a crowd of excited fans, but DIY Spider-Man is the real star of this hilarious moment",
    
    "A medium shot of an unusual garden sculpture of a 'Grass Man,' a human-like figure entirely made from thick green grass, moss, and vines, positioned in a quirky, lush setting. The Grass Man has an expression of intense concentration, his arms raised as he holds a stone toilet. From his grass-covered backside, water flows down like a waterfall, filling a small pool below. The scene is unexpectedly serene, despite the comical premise, as the water cascades down from his body into the pool, creating the image of a natural water source feeding the landscape. Palm leaves and bushes surround the sculpture, and the vibrant green plants covering his body give the impression that this figure has sprouted directly from the earth itself. Graffiti on a nearby tree reads \"Nature Calls\" in bright, playful letters, adding an extra layer of humor to the already absurd scene. The waterfall's gentle flow adds to the overall peaceful vibe, but the Grass Man's bathroom situation is the real highlight, mixing tranquility with pure absurdity in a landscape that seems to embrace the ridiculous",
    
    "A medium shot of two young women standing outdoors at a protest, holding signs advocating for climate action. Both women, likely of Caucasian descent, are dressed warmly for cold weather, wearing winter hats and gloves. The woman on the left is holding a cardboard sign that reads 'FTNA' in bold black and red letters, with smaller text beneath mentioning 'BIG BOOBS'. She is smiling slightly as she looks at the camera. The woman on the right holds a white sign with blue and green letters that reads 'FREE THE NIPPLE AGAIN' and includes a red circle with a slash through 'BRA,' referring to opposition to the Keystone XL pipeline. She is also smiling, standing close to her friend, and wearing red gloves, a blue headband, and a jacket. Behind them, other protestors are visible, some carrying signs, banners, or flags. A large flag with an image of the Earth is prominently seen to the right. The background includes a fence and some buildings, suggesting that the protest is taking place near a governmental or important public building. The atmosphere appears peaceful but determined, with people gathered in support of climate justice and renewable energy solutions",
