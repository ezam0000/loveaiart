/**
 * LoveAIArt - Modularized Codebase
 *
 * This file has been completely refactored into a modular architecture.
 *
 * New Structure:
 * - public/assets/js/core/RealEngine.js (Main orchestrator)
 * - public/assets/js/core/ModuleLoader.js (Module management)
 * - public/assets/js/core/ImageGenerator.js (Image generation)
 * - public/assets/js/core/ChatManager.js (Chat functionality)
 * - public/assets/js/core/SettingsManager.js (Settings panel)
 * - public/assets/js/components/LoraManager.js (LoRA management)
 * - public/assets/js/components/PromptEnhancer.js (Prompt enhancement)
 * - public/assets/js/utils/storage.js (Storage operations)
 * - public/assets/js/utils/validation.js (Content filtering)
 *
 * The application is now fully modular with 9 focused files under 400 lines each,
 * replacing the original 1,492-line monolithic file.
 *
 * All functionality has been preserved and enhanced with improved:
 * - Code organization
 * - Maintainability
 * - Debugging capabilities
 * - Development workflow
 *
 * No changes are needed to use the application - everything works the same!
